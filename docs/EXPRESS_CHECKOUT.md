# Express Checkout Element Integration

## Overview

LayoffScore now uses Stripe's Express Checkout Element, which provides a unified solution for all one-click payment methods. This replaces our previous custom implementation with separate buttons.

## Supported Payment Methods

The Express Checkout Element automatically shows available payment methods based on:

- Customer's browser and device
- Geographic location
- Stripe account configuration
- Customer's wallet setup

### Available Methods:

- **Apple Pay** - iOS Safari, Chrome/Edge on macOS
- **Google Pay** - Chrome browsers on any platform
- **Link** - Stripe's one-click payment method
- **PayPal** - Where enabled and supported
- **Klarna** - Buy now, pay later option
- **Amazon Pay** - For Amazon customers

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **ExpressCheckout Component** (`/components/ExpressCheckout.tsx`)

   - Handles all one-click payment methods
   - Uses Stripe's Payment Intents API
   - Provides loading states and error handling
   - Automatically determines available payment methods

2. **Updated Unlock Score Page** (`/app/unlock-score/page.tsx`)
   - Uses Elements provider wrapper
   - Combines Express Checkout with traditional card payment
   - Handles payment success/error states

### Payment Flow

1. **Express Checkout** - User clicks Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.

   - Creates Payment Intent via API
   - Uses native wallet for payment
   - Confirms payment client-side
   - Redirects to results on success

2. **Card Checkout** - User clicks "Pay with Card"
   - Redirects to Stripe Checkout
   - Handles payment server-side
   - Returns to payment-success page
   - Verifies payment and redirects to results

### Configuration

The Express Checkout Element is configured with:

- **Button Height**: 48px for consistency
- **Layout**: Max 2 columns, 2 rows with auto overflow
- **Button Types**:
  - Apple Pay: "Buy with Apple Pay"
  - Google Pay: "Buy with Google Pay"
  - PayPal: "Buy Now with PayPal"
- **Appearance**: Night theme matching app design

## Advantages Over Previous Implementation

1. **Automatic Detection**: No custom device detection code needed
2. **More Payment Methods**: Supports 6+ payment methods vs our 3
3. **Better UX**: Native wallet integrations work seamlessly
4. **Maintenance**: Stripe handles browser compatibility and updates
5. **Performance**: Single component vs multiple conditional renders
6. **Reliability**: Stripe's testing across all browsers and devices

## Testing

### Local Development

1. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set
2. Test in different browsers:
   - **Chrome**: Should show Google Pay + Link
   - **Safari**: Should show Apple Pay + Link (on macOS)
   - **Firefox**: Should show Link only
3. Test with/without wallets set up

### Test Cases

- Apple Pay (Safari on macOS with card in Wallet)
- Google Pay (Chrome with Google Pay account)
- Card payment fallback
- Payment cancellation
- Network error handling

## Browser Support

| Browser | Apple Pay | Google Pay | Link | PayPal | Others |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Chrome  | ✓ (macOS) | ✓          | ✓    | ✓      | ✓      |
| Safari  | ✓         | ✓\*        | ✓    | ✓      | ✓      |
| Edge    | ✓ (macOS) | ✓          | ✓    | ✓      | ✓      |
| Firefox | ❌        | ✓\*        | ❌   | ✓      | ✓      |

\*Requires `paymentMethods.googlePay: 'always'` setting

## Migration Notes

### Removed Code

- Custom device detection (`detectDevice`, `isApplePayAvailable`, etc.)
- Individual payment method buttons
- Browser-specific logic
- Payment Request API implementations

### Simplified Code

- Single Express Checkout component vs multiple buttons
- Automatic payment method selection
- Unified error handling
- Consistent styling across payment methods

## Future Enhancements

1. **Analytics**: Track which payment methods are most used
2. **A/B Testing**: Different button layouts and styles
3. **Regional**: Enable additional payment methods by region
4. **Subscriptions**: Add recurring payment support
5. **Mobile**: Enhanced mobile app integration

## Security

The Express Checkout Element:

- Never exposes sensitive payment data to our app
- Handles PCI compliance automatically
- Uses Stripe's secure tokenization
- Validates payment methods client-side
- Confirms payments with backend verification
